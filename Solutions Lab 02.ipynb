    "\n",
    "*Your analysis:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loss Changes**: Both training and test loss decreased significantly, which means the model is effectively learning from the data. The training loss dropped much faster and lower (from ~0.27 to ~0.05) than the test loss (from ~0.13 to ~0.08).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accuracy Gap**: Yes, there is a gap. The training accuracy (~98.5%) is higher than the test accuracy (~97.5%). This means the model is slightly better at recognizing images it has already seen compared to new, unseen images.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overfitting**: The model is starting to **overfit**. We can tell because the training loss continues to dive steeply while the test loss has flattened out and stopped improving. The widening gap between the training and test curves is a classic sign that the model is memorizing the training data rather than just generalizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Improvements**: To fix this, we could:\n",
    "   - Add **Dropout** layers to randomly disable neurons during training.\n",
    "   - Use **Data Augmentation** (rotate, shift, or zoom images) to create more variety.\n",
    "   - Use **Early Stopping** to stop training before the test loss starts to get worse."

    "\n",
    "1. **Biggest Insight**: What was your biggest \"aha!\" moment in this lab?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your answer:*\n",
    "**The confusion matrix was my biggest \"aha!\" moment.** It was powerful to clearly identify exactly where the model makes mistakes (e.g., confusing 4s with 9s) rather than just looking at a single accuracy number. This diagnostic tool gave me a much deeper understanding of the model's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conceptual Understanding**: In your own words, explain how neural networks learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your explanation:*\n",
    "**Learning is a 4-step loop:**\n",
    "1. **Guess (Forward)**: The network takes input and produces a prediction.\n",
    "2. **Measure Error (Loss)**: It compares the prediction to the truth (e.g., \"I said 7, but it's 1\").\n",
    "3. **Blame (Backward)**: Autograd calculates gradients to see which weights contributed to the error.\n",
    "4. **Update (Optimizer)**: The optimizer nudges the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient to reduce error next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Skills**: What practical skills did you gain that you could apply to other problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your list:*\n",
    "- **PyTorch Mechanics**: Creating tensors, using `requires_grad`, and `.to(device)`.\n",
    "- **Model Building**: Subclassing `nn.Module` and defining layers.\n",
    "- **Training Loops**: Writing the standard forward-loss-backward-step cycle.\n",
    "- **Diagnostics**: Using confusion matrices and loss curves to debug performance.\n",
    "- **Data Handling**: Using `DataLoader` and batches effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Challenges Faced**: What was most challenging? How did you overcome it?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your experience:*\n",
    "**Managing tensor shapes was tricky.** Flattening the 28x28 images to 784 vectors for the linear layers caused some dimension mismatch errors initially. I overcame this by constantly printing `x.shape` inside the forward method to debug and understand exactly how data flows through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Next Steps**: What would you like to learn next in deep learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Your goals:*\n",
    "I want to learn about **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. Since we treated images as flat vectors here, we lost spatial information. I'm curious to see how CNNs can handle images better by preserving their 2D structure. I'd also like to try this on color images like CIFAR-10.\n"
